## TP 2 Notes

- In exercise 1 we were able to do everything that was asked.
- We were not able to realize we would be able to reuse objects so we created TriagleOrange and TriangleBlue, but after finishing all the steps in the tp2 we were able to understand and realize this.
- At first we did not think that we needed to use matrixes, and because of thet tag tp2-1 is the last one of the tp2. In the tag the diamond is made using a matrix.

- In exercise 2 we were able to do everything that was asked. We just had some problems understanding what size the base should be, the explanation was not very clear on how the base should be done.
- In this exercice we also added colors to help us see the tangram better on top of the cube.
- In tag tp2-2 the diamond is not made using matrix.
